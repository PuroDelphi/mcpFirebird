# MCP Firebird Use Cases

This document presents practical examples and use cases for MCP Firebird.

## Use Cases

### 1. Data Analysis with LLMs

MCP Firebird allows language models like Claude to analyze data in Firebird databases, generating reports, visualizations, and recommendations based on the data.

### 2. SQL Query Assistant

Use MCP Firebird with an LLM to generate SQL queries from natural language questions, explain existing queries, or suggest optimizations.

### 3. Automatic Database Documentation

Generate detailed documentation of the database structure, including table descriptions, relationships, and usage examples.

### 4. Data Migration and Transformation

Facilitate migration between different Firebird versions or to other database systems by generating transformation scripts.

### 5. Monitoring and Diagnostics

Analyze database performance, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements in indexes or structure.

### 6. Conversational Database Interface

Create a chat interface that allows non-technical users to query and update data through natural language conversations.

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Sales Data Analysis

```
User: I need to analyze our sales data for the last quarter. Can you help me identify the top-selling products and any trends?

Claude: I'll help you analyze the sales data. Let me first check what tables are available.

[Claude uses MCP Firebird to list tables and examine the schema]

Based on the data, here are the top-selling products for Q3 2023:
1. Product X - 1,245 units ($125,450)
2. Product Y - 987 units ($98,700)
3. Product Z - 856 units ($42,800)

I've noticed a trend where sales of Product X increase by 15% on weekends, while Product Z sells better during weekdays. Would you like me to generate a detailed report with visualizations?
```

### Example 2: Database Schema Optimization

```
User: Our application is running slowly when querying the ORDERS table. Can you help optimize it?

Claude: I'll help you optimize the ORDERS table. Let me analyze its structure and query performance.

[Claude uses MCP Firebird to examine the table schema, indexes, and query execution plans]

I've identified several issues:
1. The query "SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = ?" is missing an index on CUSTOMER_ID
2. The ORDER_DATE column is being stored as VARCHAR instead of DATE type
3. There's a JOIN with CUSTOMERS table that could be optimized

Here's my recommendation for creating an index:

CREATE INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER_ID ON ORDERS (CUSTOMER_ID);

Would you like me to suggest more optimizations or help implement this one?
```

### Example 3: Data Migration Planning

```
User: We need to migrate our Firebird 2.5 database to Firebird 3.0. What should we consider?

Claude: I'll help you plan your migration from Firebird 2.5 to 3.0. Let me analyze your current database structure.

[Claude uses MCP Firebird to examine the database schema and features in use]

Based on your database, here are key considerations for migration:
1. Firebird 3.0 uses a new ODS (On-Disk Structure) version, requiring a backup/restore
2. Your database uses 8 legacy UDFs that need to be replaced with UDRs in Firebird 3.0
3. You have 3 triggers using deprecated syntax that needs updating
4. The new SQL features in FB 3.0 can optimize your complex reporting queries

Here's a step-by-step migration plan including backup commands, syntax updates, and testing procedures...

## Integration Examples

### Web Application Integration

```javascript
// Example of integrating MCP Firebird with a web application
const express = require('express');
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const app = express();

// Start MCP Firebird server
const mcpServer = spawn('npx', [
  'mcp-firebird',
  '--database', '/path/to/database.fdb',
  '--transport-type', 'sse',
  '--sse-port', '3003'
]);

// API endpoint that uses MCP Firebird
app.get('/api/sales-report', async (req, res) => {
  // Call Claude API with MCP Firebird connection info
  const claudeResponse = await callClaude({
    prompt: "Generate a sales report for the last month",
    tools: [{
      name: "mcp-firebird",
      url: "http://localhost:3003"
    }]
  });
  
  res.json(claudeResponse);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Desktop Application Integration

```csharp
// Example of integrating MCP Firebird with a desktop application
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class McpFirebirdIntegration
{
    private Process mcpProcess;
    
    public void StartMcpServer()
    {
        mcpProcess = new Process();
        mcpProcess.StartInfo.FileName = "npx";
        mcpProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = "mcp-firebird --database C:\\path\\to\\database.fdb";
        mcpProcess.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
        mcpProcess.Start();
    }
    
    public void StopMcpServer()
    {
        if (!mcpProcess.HasExited)
        {
            mcpProcess.Kill();
        }
    }
    
    public string GenerateReport(string reportType)
    {
        // Call Claude API with MCP connection
        // Process results and return formatted report
        return "Generated report content";
    }
}
```
