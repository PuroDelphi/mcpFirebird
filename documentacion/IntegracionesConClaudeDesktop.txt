Getting logs from Claude for Desktop

Claude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in ~/Library/Logs/Claude:

mcp.log will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.
Files named mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.
You can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones:


Copy
# Check Claude's logs for errors
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
Server not showing up in Claude

Check your claude_desktop_config.json file syntax
Make sure the path to your project is absolute and not relative
Restart Claude for Desktop completely
Tool calls failing silently

If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:

Check Claudeâ€™s logs for errors
Verify your server builds and runs without errors
Try restarting Claude for Desktop
None of this is working. What do I do?
