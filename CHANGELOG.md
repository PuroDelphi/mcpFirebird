# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.6.0-alpha.12] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **get-server-info tool**: Fixed hardcoded version number
  - Now reads version dynamically from package.json instead of using hardcoded "2.2.0-alpha.1"
  - Also reads name and description from package.json for consistency
  - Version now correctly reflects the actual running version

## [2.6.0-alpha.11] - 2025-10-24

### Changed
- **get-execution-plan tool**: Simplified implementation to return informative message
  - Removed all legacy code attempting to use SET PLANONLY/SET PLAN commands (isql-specific, not supported by drivers)
  - Removed attempts to use non-existent getPlan() and getInfo() methods
  - Now returns clear explanation that execution plan retrieval is not available through Node.js Firebird drivers
  - Provides detailed recommendations for using Firebird tools (isql, FlameRobin, IBExpert)
  - Suggests using analyze-query-performance tool as alternative for performance analysis

### Technical Notes
- Research confirmed that node-firebird-driver-native and node-firebird do not expose isc_dsql_sql_info API
- The Firebird API provides isc_info_sql_get_plan (constant: 22) but this is not available in high-level driver interfaces
- Low-level node-firebird-native-api would be needed but requires significant refactoring
- FDB (Python driver) successfully uses: isc_dsql_sql_info(statement_handle, [isc_info_sql_get_plan])

## [2.6.0-alpha.10] - 2025-10-24

### üîß Fixed
- **get-execution-plan Tool**: Fixed API method for retrieving execution plans with native driver
  - Changed from non-existent `statement.getPlan()` to `statement.getInfo([22])` (isc_info_sql_get_plan)
  - Uses correct Firebird API constant (22 = isc_info_sql_get_plan) to retrieve execution plan
  - Properly handles getInfo() response to extract plan string
  - Falls back to legacy method if getInfo() is not available or fails
  - **This should now correctly retrieve execution plans using the native driver API**

## [2.6.0-alpha.9] - 2025-10-24

### üîß Fixed
- **Native Driver Detection**: Fixed detection of native driver in `get-execution-plan` tool
  - Now uses `DriverFactory.getDriverInfo()` instead of `process.env.USE_NATIVE_DRIVER`
  - Properly detects when native driver is active and configured
  - Added debug logging to show driver detection status
  - **This should now correctly use `getPlan()` API when `--use-native-driver` flag is set**

## [2.6.0-alpha.8] - 2025-10-24

### üîß Fixed
- **get-execution-plan Tool**: Implemented proper native driver support using Firebird API's `getPlan()` method
  - Now uses `statement.getPlan()` from node-firebird-driver-native for accurate execution plans
  - Properly prepares statement, retrieves plan, and cleans up resources (statement, transaction, attachment)
  - Falls back to legacy methods if native driver is not available or fails
  - Improved error handling and logging for debugging
  - **Important**: `SET PLANONLY` and `SET PLAN` are isql-specific commands and don't work through programmatic drivers

### üìù Technical Details
- Native driver creates attachment, starts transaction, prepares statement, and calls `getPlan()` API method
- Legacy fallback attempts `SET PLAN ON` for pure-js driver (limited functionality)
- Comprehensive resource cleanup in all code paths (success and error)

## [2.6.0-alpha.7] - 2025-10-24

### üîß HTTP Streamable Transport Fixes
- **Fixed Stateless Mode**: Implemented correct stateless pattern following official MCP SDK documentation
- **Port Configuration Bug**: Fixed issue where `--http-port` parameter was being ignored
- **Transport Priority**: HTTP_PORT now correctly prioritized for HTTP transport type
- **Shared Server Instance**: Optimized to reuse server instance while creating new transport per request
- **MCP Inspector Compatibility**: Now works correctly with MCP Inspector without requiring session management
