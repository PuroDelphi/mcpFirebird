# MCP Firebird

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@PuroDelphi/mcpFirebird)](https://smithery.ai/server/@PuroDelphi/mcpFirebird)

Implementation of Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Firebird databases.

## What is MCP Firebird?

MCP Firebird is a server that implements Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/model_context_protocol) for [Firebird SQL databases](https://firebirdsql.org/). It allows Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to access, analyze, and manipulate data in Firebird databases securely and in a controlled manner.

## Key Features

- **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries on Firebird databases
- **Schema Analysis**: Get detailed information about tables, columns, and relationships
- **Database Management**: Perform backup, restore, and validation operations
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze query performance and suggest optimizations
- **Multiple Transports**: Supports STDIO and SSE (Server-Sent Events) transports
- **Claude Integration**: Works seamlessly with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- **VSCode Integration**: Works with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
- **Security**: Includes SQL query validation and security configuration options

## Quick Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install MCP Firebird for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@PuroDelphi/mcpFirebird):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @PuroDelphi/mcpFirebird --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g mcp-firebird

# Run the server
npx mcp-firebird --database /path/to/database.fdb
```

For backup/restore operations, you'll need to install the Firebird client tools. See [Complete Installation](./docs/installation.md) for more details.

For VSCode and GitHub Copilot integration, see [VSCode Integration](./docs/vscode-integration.md).

## Basic Usage

### With Claude Desktop

1. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration:
   ```bash
   code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json  # Windows
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json  # macOS
   ```

2. Add the MCP Firebird configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mcp-firebird": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "mcp-firebird",
           "--database",
           "C:\\path\\to\\database.fdb"
         ],
         "type": "stdio"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

### With SSE Transport

```bash
# Start with SSE transport
npx mcp-firebird --transport-type sse --sse-port 3003 --database /path/to/database.fdb
```
